            <h2>The Silicon Equalizer: Can AI Solve the Coordination Problem?</h2>
            <p class="date">January 25, 2026</p>

            <p>In a recent post, <a href="https://buildlittleworlds.github.io/plate-composition-blog/">Dr. Plate laid out a compelling case</a> for why we should stop hating the $800 concert ticket[cite: 204, 205]. He argued that prices aren’t just arbitrary numbers meant to punish us; they are "aggregated information signals"[cite: 206]. They tell us the truth about scarcity[cite: 207]. In our current world, prices are the only way millions of strangers can coordinate who gets what without a central authority deciding for them[cite: 207].</p>

            <p>It’s a powerful argument. But what if the "scarcity" Dr. Plate describes isn't a permanent law of nature, but a symptom of human labor? [cite: 208] If we introduce AI into the foundation of our economy, we might be looking at a "signal jammer" that changes the rules of value entirely[cite: 209].</p>

            <h3>The End of the "Effort Gap"</h3>
            <p>Historically, our economy is built on a hierarchy of effort and specialized skill[cite: 211]. We pay a surgeon more than a barista because the "cost" of producing a surgeon—years of training and high-intensity labor—is higher[cite: 212]. We use prices to value that difference in human effort[cite: 213].</p>

            <p>However, as AI takes over the "heavy lifting"—from diagnosing diseases and writing code to operating robotic supply chains—the nature of human work shifts[cite: 214]. We move from being the "engines" of production to being the "navigators"[cite: 215]. As economist Daniel Susskind argues in <em>A World Without Work</em>, we are seeing "task encroachment," where machines slowly take over even the cognitive tasks we thought were uniquely human[cite: 217, 253]. If we are all essentially "steering the AI," the traditional "Effort Gap" begins to close[cite: 216]. If my contribution of steering an AI to design a bridge requires the same cognitive effort as your contribution of steering an AI to manage a farm, the justification for vast wealth inequality starts to evaporate[cite: 218].</p>

            
            <h3>AI as the Foundation for a New Commune</h3>
            <p>If AI makes production nearly frictionless, we move from a world of <strong>Scarcity</strong> to a world of <strong>Abundance</strong>[cite: 220]. In Dr. Plate’s example, we need prices to decide who gets the limited number of shirts produced by human hands[cite: 221]. But if an automated factory can print a million shirts for the cost of raw materials, the "price" becomes a ghost[cite: 222].</p>

            <p>This is the core of what Jeremy Rifkin calls <em>The Zero Marginal Cost Society</em>[cite: 223, 252]. He argues that as the cost of producing an "extra" unit of a good drops to near zero, capitalism as we know it begins to eclipse[cite: 224]. In this "Post-Scarcity" model, we could actually achieve a form of communal living[cite: 225]. If everyone provides an equal unit of "steering effort," everyone could have an equal claim to the total output of the machine[cite: 226]. We wouldn't need a market to "signal" value because, for the first time in history, there would be enough for everyone[cite: 227].</p>

            <h3>The Friction in the Machine: Three Challenges</h3>
            <p>Before we close the ledger on capitalism, we have to wrestle with the "Counter-Signals" that might break this utopia[cite: 229]:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The "Steering" Skill Floor:</strong> Will "steering" really be equal? [cite: 230] Just as some people are better at searching the web than others, "Prompt Literacy" might become the new elite skill[cite: 231]. If some people can command the AI to be 10x more productive than others, do we just end up back in a world of inequality? [cite: 232]</li>
                <li><strong>The Physical Bottleneck:</strong> This is where Dr. Plate’s logic remains a hurdle[cite: 233]. AI can generate infinite digital wealth, but it cannot generate more "Earth"[cite: 234]. We still have a limited amount of land, lithium, and front-row seats[cite: 235]. Without prices, how do we decide who gets the beach house or the front-row ticket? [cite: 236]</li>
                <li><strong>The Incentive Problem:</strong> If I get an equal share of "everything" regardless of whether I steer the AI for one hour or ten, why would I do it? [cite: 237] Would a communal AI society rely on a sense of duty, or would the "Great Reset" lead to a Great Stagnation? [cite: 238]</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Conclusion: Hearing a New Signal</h3>
            <p>Dr. Plate is right: in a world of limited resources and human labor, prices are the best tool we have to see the truth[cite: 240]. But AI represents a pivot point[cite: 241]. If we can automate the "effort," we might finally be able to move toward a system where coordination isn't handled by a price tag, but by shared, automated abundance[cite: 241]. The $800 ticket is a message about scarcity[cite: 242]. Maybe it’s time we used AI to write a different message entirely[cite: 242].</p>

            <hr>

            <h3>Join the Conversation</h3>
            <p>This is an idea that definitely needs a lot of further pondering[cite: 244]. It feels massive, and honestly, every time I think I’ve solved one part of the equation, another question about human nature or physical resources pops up[cite: 245].</p>

            <p><strong>I want to hear from you:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Can you imagine a world where we "share everything" because the AI does the heavy lifting? [cite: 246]</li>
                <li>How would you solve the "Physical Bottleneck" problem Dr. Plate mentions without using money? [cite: 247]</li>
                <li>Or do you think the human urge to compete will always break a system like this? [cite: 248]</li>
            </ul>
